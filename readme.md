# dropbox-md-cms

> Super simple CMS to edit Markdown files in a Dropbox app folder

## Requirements

See `.nvmrc` or package file for the right Node version. If you use `nvm`:

```
$ nvm use
```

## Development

Create an app on Dropbox with App folder access only, generate an access token and put that in `.env`. Then install dependencies and run with Vercel (make sure you have an account and this repo is linked to a project):

```
$ npm ci
$ npx vercel dev
```

## Tech

- Built with and deploys to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- TypeScript
- Uses Node native fetch even though itâ€™s not recommended!!1
- No Dropbox SDK because why should I, also the Dropbox API is kind of weird
